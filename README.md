# Harry Potter and the Prisoner of UPENN
Welcome to the magical world of Hogwarts! In this text adventure game, you'll step into the shoes of the legendary Harry Potter, who has successfully destroyed all the horcruxes and is now on a mission to vanquish the Dark Lord, Voldemort, once and for all. However, Harry's luck isn't at its peak, and he must get rid of his bad luck before he confront Lord Voldemort!

## Gryffindor Tower:
Starting point for Harry.
Luck Potion: Harry must consume this potion to ensure his chances of successfully casting the killing curse on Voldemort.

## Ollivanders:
North of Gryffindor Tower.
Obtain the Wand: Harry must collect the wand from Ollivanders to effectively use magic against Voldemort.

## Quidditch Stadium:
East of Ollivanders.
Nimbus 2000 Broom: Harry needs to pick up the broom to enable him to fly to the Great Hall.

## Great Hall:
You need to fly 'up', and such heights can only be reached by the Nimbus 2000 Broom.
Harry must confront and defeat Voldemort in Great Hall using the 'Avada Kedavra' spell.

## Objective:
Your goal is to guide Harry Potter through Hogwarts, helping him acquire the necessary tools and potions to defeat Voldemort in the Great Hall. Be careful, as failure to pick up essential items may lead to Harry's demise.

Type commands such as 'go north', 'go east', 'drink potion', 'pick up wand', 'pick up broom', and 'go up' to navigate through Hogwarts.

Ensure that Harry picks up both the wand from Ollivanders and the Nimbus 2000 broom from the Quidditch Stadium before attempting to reach the Great Hall.

Harry must consume the Luck Potion in Gryffindor Tower to boost his luck before facing Voldemort in the Great Hall.

The final confrontation occurs when Harry reaches the Great Hall using the 'go up' command and casts the 'Avada Kedavra' spell on Voldemort.

## Winning:
Harry successfully defeats Voldemort in the Great Hall, marking the ultimate victory. Congratulations, you've conquered the Dark Lord!

## Losing:
If Harry fails to pick up the wand, doesn't drink the Luck Potion, or attempts to reach the Great Hall without the Nimbus 2000 broom, he won't stand a chance against Voldemort, resulting in Harry's defeat.

Embark on this magical journey, make wise decisions, and 'get' luck to be on your side as you guide Harry Potter to his final triumph over Lord Voldemort!
